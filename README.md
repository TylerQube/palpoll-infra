# PalPoll Deployment Pipeline
PalPoll is a full-stack quiz game played by me and my friends.

To streamline the process, and as a learning exercise in CI/CD and developer operations, I built a deployment pipeline with Docker, Docker Compose, and GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the full application to my homelab.

## Initial Configuration

- Ubuntu homelab hosts applications pulled from GitHub
- DNS records for subdomains configured via Cloudflare Dashboard
- Nginx reverse proxies traffic to respective processes

Old Deployment Workflow:
1. Push up local changes
2. SSH into my linux homelab
3. Pull the latest changes
4. Rebuild the front-end, run the back-end, and make sure MongoDB is up

## Upgraded CI/CD Workflow

### Docker
The first step in improving deployment and availability was to dockerize my existing front and backend applications.

I focused on optimizing image size through multi-stage builds using minimal base images like alpine linux

### Docker Compose
After dockerizing and testing the apps, I wrote a docker compose configuration to run the front-end, back-end, and mongodb database as a multi-container application. 

I defined this docker-compose in this repository decoupled from the application repos.

### GitHub Actions
The front-end and back-end repos run a workflow to build a docker image and push to the GitHub Container Registry.

The action then triggers a deployment workflow in this cicd repository to:
1. SSH into a low-privilege DevOps user on my homelab
2. Pull the latest changes to the docker compose config
3. Run `docker compose up`

## Next steps
- Run the app in a kubernetes cluster
- Improve monitoring and logging
